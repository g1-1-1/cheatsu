# cheatsu!

If you found yourself here, congratulations. You happen to be one of the few people to see this come to be.
This cheat only works with the Stable (Fallback) build of osu! If you can contribute and see if you can make it work on Stable, be my guest.

Currently, cheatsu! is under heavy development! This cheat is provided *free of charge* (for now), so if you paid for this hack, please report it to me. Thank you. :-)

# Instructions

 1 
  - I'm pretty sure that osu! won't detect this yet, but just for good measure; please use a MD5 hasher or a .exe packer, that way we can be *positive* that osu! won't detect it anytime soon.
  - Messing with the source code itself is also a way to make this be a undetectable cheat. peppy won't know which is the real one. :-)

 2
  - Via the AutoIt dialog box upon first launch; name the program to something you are not running, and dump all the files it produces to the folder of the program currently not running, for maximum undetectability.
  - Change the process name to that of the program you just specified.
 
 3
  - Use the search bar to search for a song. (Unsubmitted maps do not show up, will fix)
  - If you're using Hard Rock, select Hard Rock above Load.
  - Select the difficulty you're playing and load.
  - Select a tool to use ('Relax, Aimbot') and initalize it.

 4 ~not required
  - Look at the options, change them for undetectability and better performance!
  - You may want to change the hotkeys from default.
  
 5 ~not required
  - If you failed a song or quit it before finishing, osu! will continue playing it from the menu at the same part it stopped during play. Please use the hotkey designated to stop or go into the task manager and end the process. Working on a way to have it auto-stop when osu! stops playing the song.


# Bugs
  - Certain songs and difficulties cause the bot to unexpectedly crash, if you encounter this please let me know via PM.
  - Error 23 may happen; causes sliderbreaks to occur randomly.
  - If beat divisor of a song is 1 or 2, slider breaking is possible.
